# Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer

 VirtualBox and Vagrant together allow you to manage and ship isolated
 development environments. Those isolated environments in the context
 of the school (and in the future, in the context of a company) allow
 you to match the environment we use to automatically check your work.

## Project Objectives:
 This project explores the capabilities of virtual environments in 
 software/apps development. With Vagrant and VirtualBox, I'm able 
 to setup my virtual environment running Ubuntu 20.04/focal64.

### General

- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x00-vagrant)

## Tasks
### Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
- Initialized git on the virtual environment
- Configure basic info on the local machine
- Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository
	- Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
	- Public repo: zero_day
	- No README, .gitignore, or license
- On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:
	- Navigate to your home directory.
	- Create a directory zero_day.
	- Navigate to this new directory.
	- Initialize git and add the remote origin
	- Create a file README.md
	- Add this new file to git, commit the change
	- push to the remote server / origin
